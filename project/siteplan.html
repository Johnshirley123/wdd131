             It's the sequel to the 2011 video game "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine." The player assumes the role of a Space Marine a superhuman fighter of the Imperium of Man going against an alien race called Tyranid. 
             The game is full of brutal combat, with a great deal of emphasis on close combat and ranged weapons. It expands upon the lore and aesthetic.
